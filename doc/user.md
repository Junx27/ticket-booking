## User Documentation

In this repository, there is a seeder to generate default users such as admin, provider, and customer.

There are three user roles in this system, each with specific access rights based on their functions. The **admin** manages the entire system, including processing refunds in case of ticket cancellations for paid bookings. The **provider** handles the management of their own scheduling, while the **customer** makes ticket bookings.
