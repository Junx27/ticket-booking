## Schedule Documentation

In the scheduling menu, there is an option to manage scheduling based on the provider by specifying the departure location, destination location, departure time, arrival time, and the number of seats, which are automatically generated by the system. If a booking is made, the seat number will become unavailable, but if a cancellation occurs, the seat number will become available again. This menu is managed by the provider role to handle the provider's scheduling.
