## Notification Documentation

Notifications in Ticket Booking Process:

When a user makes a ticket booking, they will receive a notification confirming that the ticket reservation was successful. After the booking is successful, the user will proceed to complete the ticket purchase. Once the payment is successfully made, the user will also receive a notification confirming that the payment was successful.

If a ticket that has already been booked and paid for is later canceled by the user, this transaction will be recorded in the user's activity with the label "NOTICE," which indicates a notification that must be followed up by the admin. This transaction will have a "refund" status, and the refund will be processed within a maximum of 3 working days (3 x 24 hours).

After the refund related to the canceled and paid ticket is completed, a notification will be sent to inform the user that the refund has been processed.
